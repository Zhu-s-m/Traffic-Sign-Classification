# Traffic-Sign-Classification
Given 15540 images which constitute 15 types of traffic signs, the project aims to design
three classifiers(BPNN, Random forests, SVM) to classify the data into 15 classes and makes comparison among them. The data
are selected from parts of German Traffic Sign Recognition Dataset.
